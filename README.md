# make_seurat

This pipeline runs [cellranger-count](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/count) with a custom reference genome on FASTQ files for scRNA-seq experiments and generates Seurat objects (`.rds`) from the resulting count data with corresponding QC plots.
